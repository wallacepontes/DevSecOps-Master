# IAM with ForgeRock

Experience in Identity and Access Management (IAM), particularly with ForgeRock, involves managing and controlling user access to digital resources and systems. IAM ensures that the right individuals have access to the right resources at the right times for the right reasons. Here’s a breakdown of what this experience entails:

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
IAM involves:
- **User Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users accessing a system.
- **User Authorization**: Defining and enforcing policies that determine what resources users can access.
- **User Provisioning and Deprovisioning**: Managing the lifecycle of user accounts, from creation to deletion.
- **Access Reviews and Compliance**: Ensuring that access rights are appropriate and meet regulatory requirements.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allowing users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple systems without logging in again.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adding an extra layer of security by requiring more than one method of authentication.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigning access rights based on roles within an organization.
- **Audit and Reporting**: Monitoring and recording access activities for security and compliance purposes.

### ForgeRock Specifics
