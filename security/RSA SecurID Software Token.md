# RSA SecurID Software Token

The **RSA SecurID Software Token** is a two-factor authentication solution developed by **RSA Security**. It works by generating a one-time passcode (OTP) that is used in conjunction with a user’s regular login credentials (like a username and password) to enhance security.

Here’s how it works:

### Key Features:
1. **Software-Based**: The token is a software application (available for desktops, laptops, and mobile devices) rather than a physical hardware token. It's typically installed on a user’s smartphone or computer.
   
2. **One-Time Passcodes**: The software generates a new OTP at regular intervals (usually every 30 or 60 seconds). This code must be entered alongside the user's login credentials to access secure systems.

3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: RSA SecurID tokens rely on something the user knows (password) and something the user has (the OTP generated by the software token) for secure access.

4. **Encryption**: The generation of these OTPs is based on a combination of time (or counter-based) algorithms and a unique "seed" that's securely distributed to each token, ensuring that the OTPs are valid only for the designated user.

5. **Synchronization**: The software token is synced with the authentication server (RSA Authentication Manager). If the token and server go out of sync, a re-synchronization process may be needed.

### How It Is Used:
1. **Login Process**: When users log in to a secured system, they input their usual credentials (username and password), and then they are prompted to enter the OTP displayed by their RSA SecurID software token.
   
2. **Offline and Online Authentication**: The software token can be used for both online systems and VPNs. Additionally, if the user is offline, the software token can still generate a valid OTP since it doesn't require an internet connection.

### Benefits:
- **Portability**: Since the token is software-based, it can easily be carried on mobile devices.
- **Enhanced Security**: By requiring both the password and the OTP, RSA SecurID significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access from password-based attacks.
- **Convenience**: Users don’t need to carry a physical token; they can use their smartphone or computer for generating OTPs.

RSA SecurID Software Tokens are commonly used by businesses to secure access to sensitive corporate resources, VPNs, or applications requiring high levels of security.

## For Desktop App

1. Installing the RSA client:
- Download the RSA client from: [1](https://community.rsa.com/s/public-product-download/a9I4u000000tNMGEA2/rsa-securid-software-token-502-for-microsoft-windows-64bit)
- Once you have decompressed the downloaded package, navigate to the following folder \RSASecurIDSoftwareToken5.0.2x86\RSASecurIDToken502.zip\RSASecurIDToken502.
- Use the RSASecurIDToken502 installer.
2. Launch the RSA client and click on Token Storage Device to access the device information.
3. Communicate Device Serial Number to VPN administrator.
