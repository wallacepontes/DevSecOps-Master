# Infrastructure as Code

## Terraform

## Ansible


## is Terraform and Ansible same?

Terraform and Ansible are not the same, although they share some similarities in that they both facilitate automation in the realm of infrastructure and configuration management. However, they serve different purposes and have different areas of focus within the context of the DevOps workflow.

1. **Terraform**:
   - Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows users to define and provision infrastructure resources in a declarative configuration language. It is used for creating, managing, and updating infrastructure resources across various cloud providers and on-premises environments. Terraform is especially useful for managing complex, multi-service architectures and provides a way to define infrastructure in a version-controlled and reproducible manner.

2. **Ansible**:
   - Ansible, as mentioned earlier, is an open-source automation tool that focuses on configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It is used for automating tasks such as software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment across multiple servers. Ansible uses SSH to communicate with servers and does not require any additional software to be installed on the managed nodes.

While both Terraform and Ansible can be used for provisioning and managing infrastructure, they serve different roles in the infrastructure management process. Terraform is specifically designed for managing infrastructure resources and provisioning cloud services, whereas Ansible is more focused on configuration management and task automation, including the deployment and management of applications. They can be used together to create comprehensive automation workflows, where Terraform handles infrastructure provisioning, and Ansible takes care of configuration management and application deployment tasks.
