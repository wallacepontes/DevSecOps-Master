    1
      Data Management
        Cache: Read operation, quicker Data access
        Blob/Object Storage: Handle large/Unstructured data
        Checksum: Data Integrity during transmission
        Data Replication: Data Backup, System Reliability
    2 
      Database Selection
        RDBMS/SQL: ACID
        NO-SQL: Handling volumes of unstructured or semi data
        Graph DB: Dealing with interconnected Data
        Elasticsearch: Works best with large amount of data
    3 
      Scalibility Techniques
        Data Sharding: Partition SQL Database for large data
        Horizontal Scaling: Ideal for better performance
        Consistent Hashing: Efficient add/remove nodes
        Batch Processing: Use when system requires large volumes of data processing
    4
      Communication
        Web Sockets: Used for real-time and bidirectional communication
    5
      Geo-Location & Data Hashing
        Quadtree/Geohash: Location based systems for spatial data
        Consistent Hashing: Efficient Distribution of data across nodes
    6
      API & Microservices
        REST APIs: Build lightweight-maintainable web services
        Microservices: Breakdown your application into small services
    7 
      Modern Architecture
        Containerization Docker: Package your app with all dependencies into a single unit.
        Serverless Architecture: Focus on code, not infrastructure
    8 
      Protocols & Queues
        Message Queue: Asynchronous Communication
        Gossip Protocol: Perfect for Distributed Systems
        API Gateway: Prevent Server Overloading
        Heatbeat: Check health of nodes
    9 
      Networking
        CDN: Used to deliver content globally
        Load Balancer: Distribute app traffic across servers
        Rate Limiter: Prevent server Overloading
        Redundancy: Avoid single points of failure
